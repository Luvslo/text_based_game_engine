The kingdom of Myrtana united by King Rhobar II.
During the long years of his reign he was able to defeat all foes of his realm. All except one.
The war against the orcs took its toll and the prisoners of the realm were to pay the price.
The king needed swords for his army and every meant guilty of a crime no matter how insignificant was forced to work in the ore mines of Khorinis.
To make it impossible for them to escape the King sent out the best magicians of the kingdom to create a magic barrier around the entire valley.
I was one of them Something disturbed the delicate structure of magic. We were trapped inside our own barrier.
One second of negligence was enough for the prisoners. Khorinis was now under the control of the convicts.
The king had no choice. He had to negotiate. He needed the ore. Month after month the king supplied everything the prisoners needed.
Month after month they brought the ore at the edge of the barrier exchange. Until the present day. Another convict was brought to the cliff.
He did not know but he would change everything. One mage gave him a letter which should be reached the leader of the Magicians of Fire.
Welcome to the Colony.
You woke up on the shore of the lake. Your head hurts. You remember that any two guys beat you. Looking up you see a strange man in armor.
